# Simple Engine

This is a quick game I whipped up a while back when I was having trouble getting my main engine project running. It's a back-to-basics approach that just tried to get a full game running as quickly as possible. It doesn't run well, but that wasn't one of the requirements.

# INSTALLATION

Install python 3

# TO RUN

python3 index.py
